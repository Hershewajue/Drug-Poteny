This program will prompt the user to enter at least two two-dimensional points  and will produce the regression table Take n = number of iterations slope (m) = (n∑xy - ∑x∑y) / (n(∑x^2) - (∑x)^2) y-intercept (c) = ∑y/n - m∑x/n Pearson's corr (r) = (n∑xy - ∑x∑y) / sqrt((n(∑x^2) - (∑x)^2) - ((n∑y^2) - (∑y)^2))
